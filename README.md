# PGP Encrypt Files Static Site
This is a simple reference implementation for uploading, encrypting and downloading files, fully on the client side.

The library used for pgp is [openpgp.js](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/), intentionally left in its readable, rather than compressed and uglified format to make verification easier.
